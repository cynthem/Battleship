# Battleship
> The classic game Battleship on a static page that uses classes to track ships, gameboards, and players. Ship placement and computer moves are randomized. Uses an algorithm to target nearby board tiles when the computer hits a ship. Bundled with Webpack. This project was completed as part of The Odin Project's Full Stack Javascript curriculum.
